# sre-salt-prime

Site Reliability Engineering / DevOps SaltStack configuration files - NEW!

(This will eventually completely replace `sre-salt`.)


## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct
([`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.


## Development Notes

- **Avoid insecure repository clones:** This repository includes encrypted
  secrets. Do not run `git-crypt unlock` on clones that are not otherwise
  secured (ex. strong login password, disk encryption).
- **Avoid editing the base environment:** The base environment is configured to
  prevent commit and push actions. Please use your development environment and
  pull the changes to base.
- **Sign your commits:**
  - The master branch has the Require signed commits (Include administrators)
    GitHub branch protection enabled.
    - [About required commit signing - User Documentation][signing]
  - Ensure you are using `RemoteForward` in your SSH configuration to forward
    your GnuPG agent to `salt-prime` (see the example configurationi, under
    [Setup](#Setup), below).
  - Ensure you have configured your newly cloned repository to sign commits
    (see the `git config` command, under [Setup](#Setup), below).

### Setup

- **SSH connection information:** example local/laptop `~/.ssh/config`
  configugration:
    ```
    Host bastion-us-east-2
        HostName bastion-us-east-2.creativecommons.org
        User ARTHUR

    Host salt-prime
        HostName 10.22.11.11
        ProxyJump bastion-us-east-2
        RemoteForward /run/user/4242/gnupg/S.gpg-agent /Users/ARTHUR/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra
        User ARTHUR

    Host *
        ServerAliveCountMax 60
        ServerAliveInterval 30
        TCPKeepAlive no
    ```
    - Assumes remote username ARTHUR and remote uid 4242. Replace these values
      in your own local/laptop configuration.
    - ProxyJump allows you to `ssh salt-prime` from your local/laptop.
    - RemoteForward allows you to sign your commits.
- **Setup your development repository** on `salt-prime`:
  1. Clone repository to `/srv` with your username. For example:
        ```shell
        cd /srv
        git clone git@github.com:creativecommons/sre-salt-prime.git ${USER}
        ```
  2. Setup your newly cloned repository.
     1. Configure commit signing:
        ```shell
        cd /srv/${USER}
        git config user.email YOUR_EMAIL
        git config user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_ID
        git config commit.gpgsign true
        ```
     1. Unlock encrypted secrets:
        ```shell
        cd /srv/${USER}
        git-crypt unlock
        ```
  3. Specify the environment when you test changes. For example:
        ```shell
        sudo salt \* state.highstate saltenv=${USER} test=True
        ```
     - use `--state-verbose=True` to see successes
     - use `--state-output=full_id` to see full detail of successes
     - use `--log-level=debug --log-file-level=warning` to see debug messages
       (without logging those debug messages, which may contain secrets, to the
       log file)


### Goals

- Use AWS well, but avoid technologies that are create AWS lock-in (ex.
  Confidant)
- Salt Prime must not contain any exclusive data (use Git)
- Git repository must not contain any unencrypted secrets
- Git repository commits must be signed
- A compromised minion must not be able to escalate access
  - SysAdmins must not forward their SSH agent
  - Must not reuse application passwords (ex. Prod and Dev databases must have
    different passwords)
  - Pillar data must be restricted by Minion ID based classification
    - *The only grain which can be safely used is `grains['id']` which contains
      the Minion ID.* ([FAQ Q.21][FAQ21])


[FAQ21]: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/faq.html#is-targeting-using-grain-data-secure


### Decisions

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - Creative Commons is already using it and staff are familiar with it
  - Features allow security (ex. screened subnets, security groups policies)
  - Features allows Infrastructure as Code
  - `us-east-2`
    - cost effective
    - avoid conflict/collision over region limited resources (ex. ElasticIPs)
- Debian 9 (Stretch)
  - Free/Open Source
  - Debian Stable
  - Creative Commons is already using it and staff are familiar with it
- [git-crypt][gitcrypt] - transparent file encryption in git
  - Free/Open Source
  - Performance: files are decrypted in the checked out repository
  - Security: automatic encryption and directory based filters minimize the
    chance of unencrypted secrets being pushed to GitHub
- SaltStack
  - Free/Open Source
  - Performance
  - Creative Commons is already using it and staff are familiar with it
  - Version: `2018.3`
    - For current targeted minion version, see `minion_target_version` in
     [`pillars/salt/init.sls`](pillars/salt/init.sls)

## Host Classification

Minions are added and configured from `salt-prime` with the following Minion ID
schema: **`name__pod__location`**. Examples:
- `bastion__core__us-east-2`
- `salt-prime__core__us-east-2`

Glob patterns are used in [`pillars/top.sls`](pillars/top.sls) to ensure pillar
data is scoped appropriately (as narrowly as possible).
